# Changelog

### 2.1.0

-   Changed color of success message

-   Added padding to messages and removed width to give them a dynamic width

-   Added callback option to the cancel button on alerts, therefore I have split the parameters to be okCallback for ok button and cancelCallback for cancel button

-   Made alert appear above messages

### 2.0.0 - Rebuild

-   Added more alert types than the existing (simple alert, confirm dialog). I added a modal, side messages for normal messages, success, warnings, errors

-   Much more customization than before (just title/description text and callback). You can now change button texts, and for message can give callbacks and delay time

-   Added API documentation

-   Made the alert system within an object with methods for each type of alert

-   Complete re-style

-   Added CSS file for a dark-mode alerts style
